Physical Security: What is it & Best Practices

What is Physical Security

  Physical security refers to protecting physical access to systems, hardware, and sensitive data from unauthorized individuals. While cybersecurity often focuses on          digital threats, physical breaches can be just as damaging — allowing attackers to steal devices, plant malware, or access sensitive areas.

Why Physical Security Matters

  Even the most secure digital systems can be bypassed if someone gains physical access. You are only as strong as your weakest link.
  
    Examples:

    A stolen laptop with no encryption = full data breach.

    An attacker plugging in a rogue USB = malware or network access.

    Unauthorized person accessing a server room = potential disaster.

Common Physical Threats

  Tailgating – An unauthorized person follows an employee through a secure door.

  Device Theft – Laptops, USB drives, phones, or external hard drives stolen.

  Dumpster Diving – Retrieving sensitive documents or hardware from trash.

  Unauthorized Access – Intruders entering restricted areas like data centers.

  Visual Hacking – Reading sensitive information over someone's shoulder.

Good Practice for Physical Security

  1. Restrict Access to Sensitive Areas

    Use key cards, biometric locks, or security codes.

    Implement role-based access controls for data centers, server rooms, etc.


  2. Secure Devices

    Use cable locks for laptops and locking cabinets for servers or backups.

    Always log out or lock screens when stepping away.


  3. Monitor and Respond

    Install CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and security alarms.

    Conduct routine physical security audits.

  
  4. Shred and Dispose Securely

    Use cross-cut shredders for paperwork.

    Wipe or physically destroy hard drives before disposal.


  5. Encrypt and Backup

    Use full disk encryption (e.g., BitLocker, FileVault).

    Store encrypted backups in a locked, off-site, or cloud environment.

  
  6. Train Employees

    Teach staff to challenge tailgaters and report suspicious behavior.

    Encourage awareness of surroundings and the importance of physical controls.
